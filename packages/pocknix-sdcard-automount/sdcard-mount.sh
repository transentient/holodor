# sdcard-mount.sh — pocknix port of Valve's SteamOS SD-card automount helper.
#
# Called by 99-pocknix-sdcard-automount.rules (via systemd-run) on insert/removal of an ext4
# mmcblk partition. It mounts the card under /run/media, hands ownership to the Steam session
# user, and — the part a bare udev mount rule is missing — tells the RUNNING Steam client about
# it over its pipe with steam://addlibraryfolder, so the card actually shows up in the gamescope
# UI's Storage list. Without that IPC call Steam never surfaces a live-inserted card.
#
# Adapted from Valve's /usr/lib/hwsupport/sdcard-mount.sh. Three pocknix-specific changes vs Valve:
#   1. Session user is uid 1001 (`deck`), NOT Valve's 1000 — on pocknix uid 1000 is `alarm`.
#   2. The steam:// URL is sent via the NATIVE ARM client (~/.local/share/Steam/steamrtarm64/steam);
#      Valve's ./.steam/root/ubuntu12_32/steam is the x86 bootstrap and won't execute on aarch64.
#   3. The card is mounted with an ext4 idmap that swaps SteamOS's deck uid/gid (1000) with ours
#      (1001). Every SteamOS device numbers `deck`=1000, which is why an ext4 card roams freely
#      between them. pocknix numbers `deck`=1001, so a card written elsewhere lands on-disk as 1000
#      and Steam (running as 1001) can't write into steamapps -> "Missing file privileges". The
#      idmap presents on-disk 1000 as our 1001 and writes our files back to disk as 1000, so a
#      single card moves between a pocknix device and a real SteamOS device untouched. This
#      replaces Valve's post-mount `chown` of the mount root, which only re-owned the top dir
#      (leaving steamapps/ unwritable) and stamped an on-disk 1001 that broke the card elsewhere.
